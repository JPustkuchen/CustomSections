########## Custom Section demo type "Multi-Date Event" #############

This is meant as a demo type for the Custom Sections plugin. 
We recommend to keep it untouched for reference. 

If you want to use this item in a modified form, make a copy 
of this folder (e.g. 'my_multi_date_event') 

You can disable this section type by renaming it's folder
to start with a !(exclamation mark)
